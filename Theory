//Feature engineering is the process of using domain knowledge to extract features from raw data.These features can be used to improve the performance of ML algo.
//We cant give the raw data to ML model,so the process of modification of the raw data into modified data to be given to the ML model is called feature engineering.

Types of feature Engineering
1)Feature Transformation-(Treansforming or changing the given features to get a new feature data)
   a)Missing Value Computation-(Missing values can be replaced by mean,median pr mode or the row can be completely removed)
   b)Handling Categorical Features-(Categorical features can be created and used as required)
   c)Outlier Detection-(Detect and remove the outlier to get more approximate result for eg in regression)
   d)Feature Scaling-(Let us have a data set having features as age and area in sq feet of their house.So if we use an algo like KNN,where euclidean dist is used to find nearest neighbour to a test point then since arae has comparebly larger value than age,it will dominate thus we need to scale the area properly to get correct result)
2)Feature Construction-(Techniques->feature splitting,grouping//Create a completely new column.It depends on your domain knowledge,experience or intution.I can combine two columns under the name family if the columns given are parent and child respectively.Now I can further convert it into categorical type like if the number is 0->alone,0-4->small and so on)
3)Feature Selection-(Selecting some few columns/features to study the data which are more import-extracting important features)
4)Feature Extraction-(Creating a completely new feature from our feature column programmatically.eg-PCA-->I am studying house pricing and the features are rooms and washrooms.But i want to have only one feature so,i will create a completely new feature called square feet area)
